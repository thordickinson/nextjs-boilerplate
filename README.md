# Boilerplate template for apps

## Setting up mongo Database

1. Run `./mongo.sh` from bash. This will start a docker container with mongo. 
2. Before running this application you'll need to create a mongo user since you cannot use root user. I recommend to create a user boilerplate as username and password. Those are the default credentials used when connecting. 
3. Now yow can run the app using `npm run dev`, this will start the server.
4. Go to http://localhost:3100 in your web browser.
5. Edit the files and see the changes automatically updated on your browser.
